# Statamic 6 documentation sources

Primary:
- Website: https://statamic.dev/
- GitHub mirror (markdown): https://github.com/statamic/docs

Secondary (news / ecosystem context; not canonical API docs):
- Laravel Boost v2 overview: https://laravel-news.com/laravel-boost-v2

Notes:
- Prefer statamic.dev content when it is clearly the source of truth.
- Use the statamic/docs repository for full-text search, diffs, and deep linking into Markdown.
- Always state the Statamic major version assumptions (target: 6).
