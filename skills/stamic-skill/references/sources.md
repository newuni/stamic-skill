# Statamic 6 documentation sources

Primary:
- Website: https://statamic.dev/
- GitHub mirror (markdown): https://github.com/statamic/docs

Notes:
- Prefer statamic.dev content when it is clearly the source of truth.
- Use the statamic/docs repository for full-text search, diffs, and deep linking into Markdown.
- Always state the Statamic major version assumptions (target: 6).
