# Backend & APIs: Dirty State Tracking

**Status (docs):** The Statamic 6 docs page currently shows **“Nothing to see here.”** for this topic.

## What to do instead
- For CP forms and Vue components, follow the documented fieldtype/widget/utility patterns and rely on Statamic’s publish form/store mechanisms.
- If you need the original “Dirty State Tracking” details, check Statamic 5 docs or the Statamic source.
