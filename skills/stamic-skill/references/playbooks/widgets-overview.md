# Widgets: Overview (All Widgets)

**Summary:** Widgets are small dashboard components shown in the Statamic Control Panel dashboard. Core widgets include: Collection, Form, and Updater.

**When to use:**
- You want editors/admins to see high-signal dashboard information in CP.
- You need a quick inventory of built-in widgets before building a custom one.

## Steps
1. Start by choosing the built-in widget that matches the need (Collection/Form/Updater).
2. Configure dashboard placement and visibility based on user roles/workflows.
3. If built-ins are insufficient, continue with the custom widget playbook.

## Core widgets
- Collection widget — list entries from a collection
- Form widget — list recent form submissions
- Updater widget — shows available core/addon updates

## Pitfalls / gotchas
- Overloading dashboards with too many widgets reduces signal for editors.
- Built-in widget expectations differ from custom widget behavior; validate UX before replacing.
