# Backend & APIs: Slugs

**Status (docs):** The Statamic 6 docs page currently shows **“Nothing to see here.”** for this topic.

## What to do instead
- For slug behavior in content modeling/routing, rely on collection routing + blueprint fields (common: `slug` field) and validation.
- If you’re extending slug generation/normalization, check Statamic 5 docs or the Statamic source.
