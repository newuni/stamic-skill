# Backend & APIs: Query Scopes & Filters

**Status (docs):** In Statamic 6.x the docs page for **Query Scopes & Filters** currently renders as **“Nothing to see here.”**

## What to do instead
- Check the 5.x docs via the version switcher.
- Inspect Statamic source for:
  - Query builders / scopes
  - Filter classes used in CP listings and tags
- For day-to-day filtering, many cases are covered by:
  - Antlers tag parameters (e.g. `collection:*`, `entries:*`)
  - Eloquent driver / Laravel query builder when using database-backed storage
