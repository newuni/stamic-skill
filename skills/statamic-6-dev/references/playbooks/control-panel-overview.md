# Control Panel: Overview

**Summary:** The Control Panel (CP) is Statamic’s admin UI for content, assets, users/permissions, forms, utilities, and addon tooling. In v6 it’s designed to be fast and editor-friendly, with features like the Command Palette.

**When to use:**
- Onboarding: “what is where in the CP?”
- Mapping a task (content, users, assets, forms) to the right CP area.

## Steps
1. Use **Dashboard** as the team’s command center (widgets for what matters).
2. Manage content via **Collections** and **Globals**.
3. Manage files via the **Asset Browser**.
4. Manage access via **Users** (roles/permissions).
5. Use the **Command Palette** (⌘K / Ctrl+K) to navigate and run actions quickly.
6. Adjust **Preferences** (per user/role/default).
7. Use CP tools when relevant: Live Preview, Git Automation, Revisions, Utilities.

## Pitfalls / gotchas
- Many CP behaviors are configurable and role-sensitive; always consider permissions and preference overrides.
