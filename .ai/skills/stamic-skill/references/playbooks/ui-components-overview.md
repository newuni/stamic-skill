# UI Components: Overview

**Summary:** Statamic provides a library of UI components used across the Control Panel (buttons, inputs, icons, panels, widgets, etc.). When building CP extensions (addons, fieldtypes, utilities, widgets), prefer these components for consistent styling/behavior.

**Where to look:**

## Notes
- Docs pages on statamic.dev often link into the Storybook for component-specific APIs.
- In Vue/fieldtypes you’ll commonly import from `@statamic/cms/ui`.
