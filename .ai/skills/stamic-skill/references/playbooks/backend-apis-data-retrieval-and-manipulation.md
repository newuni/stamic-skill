# Backend & APIs: Data Retrieval and Manipulation

**Status (docs):** In Statamic 6.x this page currently renders as **“Nothing to see here.”**

## What to do instead
- Use Statamic facades/APIs for data types (Entry/Collection/Term/Asset/User/etc.) and their repositories.
- If extending storage/retrieval, see **Repositories**.
- If you need “resource APIs”, check version 5.x docs or source.
