# Backend & APIs: Event Bus

**Status (docs):** The Statamic 6 docs page currently shows **“Nothing to see here.”** for this topic.

## What to do instead
- Use **Laravel Events** (Statamic dispatches many events) for backend decoupling.
- For Control Panel/Vue interactions, use Statamic’s documented JS APIs (callbacks, Vue components, Inertia pages) and UI patterns.
- If you specifically need “Event Bus” behavior, check:
  - Statamic 5 docs (switch version selector to 5.x)
  - Statamic source code / docs repo (`statamic/docs`)
