# Backend & APIs: Progress

**Status (docs):** The Statamic 6 docs page currently shows **“Nothing to see here.”** for this topic.

## What to do instead
- For long-running operations in the CP, use:
  - queued jobs + notifications/toasts
  - Inertia pages + polling
  - custom utilities/routes
- If you need the “Progress” API details, check Statamic 5 docs or the Statamic source.
